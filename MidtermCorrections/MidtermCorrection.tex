\subsection*{Question 7}
I originally \lstinline|GROUPED BY| only the \lstinline|Company.company_id| without realizing that created ambiguity between what \lstinline|company_name| to use per group.
The corrected query would be:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
    SELECT company_name, SUM(salary)
    FROM Company JOIN Works 
    ON Works.company_id = Company.company_id 
    GROUP BY Company.company_id, Company.company_name 
    ORDER BY SUM(Works.salary) ASC LIMIT 1;
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Question 8}
I think I did not realize that the question asked for \textit{managers} to get a 10-percent raise.
The corrected query would be:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
    UPDATE Works SET salary = salary * 1.10 
    WHERE employee_id IN (
        SELECT Works.employee_id
        FROM Works 
        JOIN Company ON Company.company_id = Works.company_id
        JOIN Manages ON Works.employee_id = Manages.manager_id
        WHERE Company.company_name = "First Bank Corporation"
    );
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection*{Problem 10}
I misunderstood the question, which was asking for the second-degree users and how many followers they have, rather than how many people they follow.
The corrected query would be:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=SQL]
    SELECT F1.follower, COUNT(DISTINCT F2.follower) AS num
    FROM Follow F1
    JOIN Follow F2 ON F1.follower = F2.followee
    WHERE F1.follower IN (
        SELECT followee FROM Follow
    )
    GROUP BY F1.follower
    ORDER BY F1.follower;
\end{lstlisting}
